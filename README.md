# MERN Dashboard (Work in Progress)

Welcome to the MERN Dashboard project! This dashboard is currently in progress, leveraging the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack, along with Tailwind CSS for styling, react-router-dom for navigation, and possibly recoil for state management. The planned functionalities include user authentication with NextAuth, user profiles, chart visualization, and a responsive sidebar.

## Tech Stack

- **MongoDB:** A NoSQL database for scalable and flexible data storage.
  
- **Express:** Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
  
- **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
  
- **Node.js:** JavaScript runtime for server-side development.

- **NextAuth:** Authentication library for Next.js applications.

- **react-router-dom:** A routing library for React applications.

- **recoil (Possibly):** A state management library for React applications.

- **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for building modern designs.

## Planned Functionalities

- **User Authentication:**
    - Sign in and sign up using NextAuth for secure authentication.

- **User Profiles:**
    - View and manage user profiles.

- **Chart Visualization:**
    - Incorporate charts for data visualization.

- **Responsive Sidebar:**
    - Design a responsive sidebar for seamless navigation.
